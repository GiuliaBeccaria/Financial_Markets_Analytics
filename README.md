# Financial Markets Analytics Project

## Overview
This project focuses on developing screening models using data from the "euro.xls" file, which contains key indicators for 797 securities over a time period of 111 months. The goal is to analyze different screening strategies and evaluate their performance in constructing portfolios.

- Introduction
- Univariate Screening and Transaction Costs
- Multivariate Strategy
- Correlation Problem
- Sequential Screening
- Conclusions and Further Developments

## Key Indicators
The project utilizes various key indicators such as PE Ratio, EBITDA Margin, RSI, Market Capitalization, and more to identify investment opportunities based on specific criteria.

## Methodology
- Univariate Screening: Focuses on selecting securities based on a single factor, such as EBITDA Margin.
- Multivariate Strategy: Utilizes a combination of factors to screen securities and construct portfolios.
- Sequential Screening: Implements a sequential approach to screening strategies over time.

## Results
The multivariate sequential screening strategy demonstrates superior performance compared to other methods, as indicated by metrics like Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, and Information Ratio.

## Future Developments
Potential enhancements include addressing collinearity issues, incorporating advanced screening models like machine learning strategies, and further refining the screening criteria for better portfolio construction.
